# Turdle
Turdle is a game I am developing in python similar to Wordle. You have 5 tries to guess the 5 letter word. I am working on a UI and loop for music later!

To run:
- 
- Install python 3.9+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- When installing python, please check to include Python in PATH (This will allow you to use pip command in terminal).
- Open a Terminal (Windows PowerShell is fine) and type: 
  pip install numpy
  pip install pygame
(This package is needed, as I used the numpy library in the code.)

 - Unzip all files into a folder named Turdle.
- In the Folder where you extracted the files, double click the run.bat file to run the game.

Enjoy the Game!
