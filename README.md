# Turdle
Turdle is a game I am developing in python similar to Wordle. You have 5 tries to guess the 5 letter word. I am working on a UI later! Music and sounds are complete and working in-game.

Install Python 3.9+:
- 
- Install python 3.9+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - When installing python, please check 'Include Python in PATH' (This will allow you to use pip command in terminal).

Install Packages
-
- Just run the install.bat file and it will do all the installs for you!

    - Or use a Terminal (Windows PowerShell is fine)

      Type one at a time and press Enter

        - pip install numpy

        - pip install pygame

        (These packages are needed as I used the numpy and pygame libraries in the code.)
        
- If you get an error that pip is not a recognized command, reinstall python and check the box to Include Python in the PATH


Play Game
-
- Unzip all files into a folder named Turdle.
- Double-Click the run.bat file in the Turdle folder you just unzipped.

Enjoy the Game!
