# Turdle
Turdle is a game I am developing in python similar to Wordle. You have 5 tries to guess the 5 letter word. I am working on a UI later! Music and sounds are complete and working in-game.

To run:
- 
- Install python 3.9+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- When installing python, please check 'Include Python in PATH' (This will allow you to use pip command in terminal).

In Terminal 
-
(Windows PowerShell is fine)

- Type one at a time and press Enter

pip install numpy

pip install pygame

(These packages are needed as I used the numpy and pygame libraries in the code.)

Play Game
-
- Unzip all files into a folder named Turdle.
- In the Folder where you extracted the files, double click the run.bat file to run the game.

Enjoy the Game!
