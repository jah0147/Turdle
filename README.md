# Turdle
Turdle is a game I am developing in python similar to Wordle. You have 5 tries to guess the 5 letter word. I am working on a UI and loop for music later!

To run:
Download python 3.9+
install pip

Go to the directory containing main.py in terminal and type:
  pip install playsound
  pip install numpy
  python main.py

Enjoy the game!
